# coda_utilities
Functions and scripts to perform compositional data analysis

Still a little bit of a work in progress, but basic operations and transformations are included in coda_ops_transforms.jl. This script also contains zero-imputation with mulitiplicative Baynesian approach following Martin-Fernandez etal 2015. Working code for my own projects are included (please note these are not full examples - will try to do that soon), and include examples for Aitchison variation, biplot construction, multivariate regression with ilr transforms and other things.
